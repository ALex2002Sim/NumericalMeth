### [LAB №4](https://github.com/ALex2002Sim/NumericalMeth/blob/main/lab5.ipynb)
1. In this part of the work, the population of a certain city in the next year is modeled using LS and interpolation, and the results are compared.
2. Here we consider the approximation of a given function by Lagrange and Hermite polynomials.
3. Here you will find an economization of the Taylor series using the Chebyshev polynomial.

### [LAB №5](https://github.com/ALex2002Sim/NumericalMeth/blob/main/lab6Simakov.ipynb)
In this work, the Cauchy problem is solved using the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods (3rd order of accuracy). A study is also carried out to determine the optimal step and number of partition points. Graphs built

### [LAB №6](https://github.com/ALex2002Sim/NumericalMeth/blob/main/lab7Simakov.ipynb)
1. In this work, we study the dependence of the numerical solution of the Cauchy problem using two methods (see [them here](https://github.com/ALex2002Sim/NumericalMeth/blob/main/lab6Simakov.ipynb)). First, the problem is solved with a fixed step, then with a fixed accuracy, the results are compared.
2. In this part of the work we work with the Cauchy problem for two systems of ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. The problem is solved by the Euler method, then by the implicit Euler method. The following is a comparison of the results obtained.

1. In this work you will find a numerical solution to a boundary value problem for a second-order differential equation using the finite difference method.
2. In this part of the work, we find a numerical solution to the boundary value problem generated by the following problem
